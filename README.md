## Installation
Installation instructions for application:
npm i to install dependencies.

## Usage
After cloning or forking the repository and ensuring node is installed and all dependencies, navigate to the repository folder and run node index.js.  From there, a series of questions will populate via console.  The application will ask the user to enter a max of 3 letters for the text on the logo, to enter a color (text or hexidecimal) for the text, and select a shape for the logo to be in.  The final question is choosing a color for the shape, and then a message appears in the console indicating that a logo has been generated and can be found in the examples folder of the repository.  From there, the user can view the raw SVG code and preview the logo.
